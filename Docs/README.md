This is an introduction to additional MIMIC-CXR licensing methods.

This dataset is a public dataset distributed by physionet under MIMIC-CXR. In order to use the dataset, it is necessary to perform relevant training and obtain permission for use authentication from the data organizer, MIT. Since the dataset itself corresponds to a human body-derived material and contains a considerable amount of personal information, the screening process and training procedure are as follows.

1. Physionet membership
Membership registration is performed through the URL below.
https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/files/#files-panel

2. Completion of training required for data
The training consists of a CITI Course, and the basic introduction can be found at https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/ . Education is a form of examination based on electronic documents, and the training site is https://www.citiprogram.org/members/index.cfm?pageID=50 . There is a list of things to do to obtain data, although there is a variety of education. The training list can be found at the URL above.
  
3. Download Certification and Submit Certificates
You can download certification from "My Records" after completing all of the training. Subsequently, the downloaded certificate is submitted at https://physionet.org/settings/training/ .
    
4. Create Data Utilization Consent
At the bottom of the link above https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/files/ #files-panel, there is a final process including the contents introduced so far. If you click on the data usage agreement and sign in after logging in, a review is requested to MIT. The process takes about 2 to 8 weeks to review.

5. Submission of certification to KYMEKA team
Researchers who have completed all the processes so far and even obtained a review at MIT should forward the MIT certificate and the data usage authorization document (Google survey link) of the KYMEKA team to the KYMEKA team. The MIT certificate and data usage authorization document are reviewed together for authorization.
